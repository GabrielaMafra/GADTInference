# OutsideIn - Type Inference

A very simple implementation of [this approach](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/complete-and-decidable-type-inference-for-gadts/).

`input.txt` has multiple data declarations followed by one expression.

Run `generate` to get generated constraints.

Run `solve` to get the type infered.

This implementation is far from done.
