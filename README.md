# OutsideIn - Type Inference

A very simple implementation of [this approach](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/complete-and-decidable-type-inference-for-gadts/).

An entry has multiple data declarations followed by one expression. Each entry is separated by an empty line;

Run `generate "file"` to get generated constraints.

Run `solve "file"` to get the type inferred.

This implementation is far from done.
